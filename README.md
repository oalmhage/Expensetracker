A C# project that my classmate and I collaborated on is a budget management application.

This software serves as an expense tracker, allowing users to add, edit, and delete expenses.

In addition to these basic features, the program offers two additional functionalities. It can calculate the sum per category, both with and without VAT (Value Added Tax), and compute the overall total sum of all expenses, again with or without VAT.
